  networks:
    home_warehouse_be:

#. Copy ``./warehouse-api/.env.prod`` to ``./warehouse-api/.env`` and edit to match your requirements
#. From repository directory run ``poetry run python home_warehouse_api/main.py``

--------------
Without poetry
--------------
#. Setup python for version 3.9
#. Pull repository to desired directory
#. Install packages from requirements file
#. Copy ``./warehouse-api/.env.prod`` to ``./warehouse-api/.env`` and edit to match your requirements
#. From repository directory run ``poetry run python home_warehouse_api/main.py``

#. Make sure you have installed API with steps listed before.
#. While tesiting export path for API files ``export PYTHONPATH=home_warehouse_api``
#. Run command with poetry ``poetry run pytest`` or without poetry ``pytest``
