Development
===========

It is recommended to use tool `Poetry
<https://python-poetry.org/>`_ with python 3.9


-----------
With poetry
-----------
#. Pull repository to desired directory
#. Run ``poetry install``
#. Copy ``./warehouse-api/.env.prod`` to ``./warehouse-api/.env`` and edit to match your requirements
#. From repository directory run ``poetry run python home_warehouse_api/main.py``

--------------
Without poetry
--------------
#. Setup python for version 3.9
#. Pull repository to desired directory
#. Install packages from requirements file
#. Copy ``./warehouse-api/.env.prod`` to ``./warehouse-api/.env`` and edit to match your requirements
#. From repository directory run ``poetry run python home_warehouse_api/main.py``


-------
Testing
-------
#. Make sure you have installed API with steps listed before.
#. While tesiting export path for API files ``export PYTHONPATH=home_warehouse_api``
#. Run command with poetry ``poetry run pytest`` or without poetry ``pytest``
